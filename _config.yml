summary: 'Honest, dynamic and also speed in learning new things are my main three words to describe myself towards my work.  The limited formal education is my disadvantage, but I believe with the drive, effort and passion I will have ability to deal with challenges. In my free time I enjoy listening music, playing games, occasionally writing code, playing around with new web technologies, and taking pictures. I donâ€™t pretend to be a photographer, even though I find myself quite enjoying taking and processing pictures.'
